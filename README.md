# Deloitte FED coding challenge

## Requirements:
1. Browser requirements are desktop IE11+, latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge. Please let us know which browser you’ve used to develop in (e.g. Chrome/Firefox)
2. This site is responsive with a minimum size of 320px and at least should support iPad portrait and landscape.
3. Unfortunately, the designer hasn’t done mobile designs and would like you to recommend the solution directly in the HTML so they can review it after you’ve built it.
4. JS functionality (you can use jQuery as well if you like):
he designer has requested a carousel. The animation can be chosen by you and it should also work on mobile
  * Large images without captions will have a modal window that displays the caption on click of the image.
  * Please annotate anywhere you think there might be accessibility issues and how you might get around them.
  * If you're using SASS/SCSS/LESS, please include your construction files as well as the output HTML.

## Built With
* This application was developed on OS X El Capitan Version 10.11.6 - using Chrome.

## Issues Addressed

* Modal windows on images without captions were not implemented due to time restrictions.

Main issue with accessibility would be the image heavy content and cannot effectively tab through site.
